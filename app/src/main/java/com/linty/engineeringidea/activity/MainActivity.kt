//Flow:
//1.	The main screen should have a toolbar with back button.
//2.	On launch, the app should display all images from user’s device gallery.
//3.	The user’s images should be displayed as squares; 3 columns on portrait, and 5 on landscape.
//4.	Upon tapping an image, a loading spinner should be displayed on the image, and the original image should be uploaded to “imgur”
//(https://apidocs.imgur.com/#58306db8-0a6f-4aa1-a021-bdad565f153e)
//a.	Note that as long as the image is uploaded, the spinner should be displayed on the correct image, even on scrolling the screen down and up.
//b.	Images should be uploaded on a queue, one by one.
//c.	In case of an upload failure, and the images screen is visible, display an alert.
//5.	On the top right of the navigation bar, add a “links” button which will push a table list of all urls to images uploaded by the app.
//6.	The urls list should be persistent; re-running the app should display the list as it was the last run.
//7.	Tapping a url on the list, should open the native browser with the url, displaying the uploaded image on the web.
//
//
//What do we expect?
//●	Object Oriented code is required
//●	The app should be built by a strict conventional design pattern as you choose
//●	No memory leaks should occur in the app
//●	Interface Builder should be used correctly to define UI
//●	No compilation errors or warnings
//●	Smooth performance even with a large amount of photos
//●	Documentation and comments are highly appreciated
